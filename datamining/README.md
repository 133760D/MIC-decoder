## Breaking the code
Currently only the Xerox first pattern model, and partially the quaternary pattern, have been publicly decoded.

The few selected images in this repo are extracts from the datamining initiative of the EFF, thanks to them. Available on the German Research Center for Intelligence [here](https://madm.dfki.de/files/downloads/mic-bw.zip) (this is a direct download link).

Please note that the followings have been picked up because they seem to have a strongly noticeable pattern, currently none of them have ever been publicly decoded (except the Quaternary pattern partially). More data is needed to decode them - I don't even own a printer.

If you have scans with similar patterns or other strongly noticeable pattern feel free to add them to the list.

### Scope
There are many more patterns, some are diagonally aligned, some look randoms, some seem to be curves, here only isolated and grid patterns are analysed.

### Data description
- HP\_Laserjet\_3700DN.avif | HP Laserjet 3700DN | serial number: CNDEF05502 | EFF id: 0008 | pattern is easily recognizable and not random; triangles / diamond shape; oddly symetrical.
- HP\_LaserJet\_3700DN\_2.avif | HP Laserjet 3700DN | serial number: CNKEX00370 | EFF id: 0019 | idem
- Konica\_Minolta\_Colorforce\_8050.avif | Konica Minolta Colorforce 8050 | serial number: 1C16C181FD4857FF | EFF id: 0013 | Quaternary pattern - currently partially decoded.
